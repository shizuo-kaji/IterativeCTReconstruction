# IterativeCTReconstruction
Iterative CT Reconstruction regularised by CNNs (Deep Image Prior and Discriminator)

# Requisite
At least, projection data, projection matrix, and conjugate projection matrix are necessary to use this code.
Currently, this code is not for everyone. Detailed usage will be given when ready.

For now, look at
```
python iterativeReconst.py -h
```
